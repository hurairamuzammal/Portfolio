# Muhammad Abu Huraira - Developer Portfolio

A highly interactive, deeply immersive portfolio application themed around space exploration. Built to showcase a wide range of projects spanning from high-performance Flutter mobile applications to custom Artificial Intelligence and NLP models. 

## About The Project

This portfolio is entirely custom-built utilizing **React**, **Vite**, **TypeScript**, and **Tailwind CSS**. It was designed with a heavy emphasis on breathtaking visual aesthetics and smooth viewport animations powered by **Framer Motion**. 

As you scroll through the application, you journey straight through a literal "tech universe". The viewport features an active parallax background rendering a 60-fps particle generation of stars, comets, and deeply detailed celestial bodies. The experience transitions abruptly via a hardware-accelerated, multi-stage, 3D rocket launch sequence that physically propels the user deep into the main project and experience sections.

### Key Features
* **Infinite Celestial Canvas:** A custom HTML5 Canvas rendering engine tracking the cursor and scroll position to calculate real-time parallax for dynamic stars and multi-layered glowing planets (Saturn, Jupiter, Earth, Neptune).
* **Cinematic Rocket Launch Sequence:** A highly detailed, physics-based scroll animation triggered halfway through the timeline, utilizing raw CSS gradients and transform optimizations for maximum performance.
* **Intelligent Spotlight Tracking:** A global spotlight effect that gently illuminate the dark-mode layout by tracking pure cursor coordinates over the background.
* **Component-Level Optimizations:** Designed with pure functional React components. Heavy SVGs are pulled from `react-icons` and `lucide-react`, lazy-rendered only when inside the viewport.
